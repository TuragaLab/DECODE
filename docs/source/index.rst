DECODE Manual
=============
This is the documentation of the DECODE Deep Learning for Superresolution Localization Microscopy.

Get Started
###########
To try out DECODE we recommend to first have a look at the Google Colab notebooks.

DECODE on Google Colab
""""""""""""""""""""""
Our notebooks below comprise training a model, fitting experimental data and exporting the fitted localizations.

* `Training a DECODE model <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uQ7w1zaqpy9EIjUdaLyte99FJIhJ6N8E?usp=sharing>`_
* `Fitting high-density data <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HAvJUL29vVuCHMZHMbU9jxd4fbLIPdhZ?usp=sharing>`_

DECODE on your machine
""""""""""""""""""""""
The installation is described in detail here `installation instructions. <installation.html>`__

Once you have installed DECODE on your local machine, please follow our
`Tutorial. <tutorial.html>`__

Video tutorial
###############
As part of the virtual `I2K 2020 <https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/conferences/from-images-to-knowledge-with-imagej-friends>`__ conference we organized a workshop on DECODE. Please find the video below.

*DECODE is being actively developed, therefore the exact commands might differ from those shown in the video.*
