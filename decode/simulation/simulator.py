    A simulation class that holds the necessary modules, i.e. an emitter source (either a static EmitterSet or
    a function from which we can sample emitters), a psf background and noise. You may also specify the desired frame
    range, i.e. the indices of the frames you want to have as output. If they are not specified, they are automatically
    determined but may vary with new sampled emittersets.

        em_sampler: instance with 'sample()' method to sample EmitterSets from
        frame_range: frame indices between which to compute the frames. If None they will be
        auto-determined by the psf implementation.
